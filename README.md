# UniversalAPI
An API that uses AI to simulate the entire internet! Or, well, a specific website.

This is very much inspired by LiveOverflow's [Everything API](https://github.com/LiveOverflow/everything-api) project, but that was back in 2023 where the best LLM model was GPT-3.5 Turbo (which... wasn't THAT crash hot looking back on it). Now, in 2025, you can get access to 100x better models for way cheaper.
